## Script objective

This script preps the raw bioloigcal replicate count/experimental data for normalization by:
  
    * Removing low expressed counts 
    
    * Identifying potential outlier replicates
    
    * Combining counts with complete expermiental meta-data

See: analyses/step1.data_prep/README.md for how input data to this script was generated. 

## Load data from previous run

* Load the tximport object which contains biological replciates
    ```{r raw.count, cache=F, echo=TRUE}
      # bio counts
      load("/media/disk6/ARF/RNASEQ/counts/86kSalmon/bio_rep_txi_count_data_object.RData")
      names(txi)
    ```
    
    * The txi object is a list of 5 elements containing the counts, bootstrap variance estimates, and effect txpt lengths for each respective sample.
    
* Load complete experimental meta data
    ```{r raw.phenos, cache =F, echo=TRUE}
      # expt data
      load("/media/disk6/ARF/RNASEQ/Breeding-Value-Prediction/disk6directory/resources/expt.dat.720.RData")
      dim(expt.dat.720)
    ```
    
    * The experimental data set contain 720 rows and 36 columns.  Each row correspond to a technical replicate and each column corresponds to a piece of meta-deta describing the techincal replicate.
    
    * Note that the experiment meta-data needs to be consolidated to bioloigcal replicates in order to match the txi object.  This will be done next by identifying the column names and removing certain ones which uniquely describe the techincal replicates.

## Combine raw counts and experiment info

* Print the column names of the experimental data frame.
    
    ```{r meta.colnames, cache=F, eval=TRUE}
    colnames(expt.dat.720)
    ```

      * Lot's of stuff in here.  The ones which are unique to technical replicates within a given biological replicate are:
          * lane (col 6)
          * fl_mean (col 8)
          * salmple_id (col 10)
          * salmon_input_path (col 11)
          * salmon_output_path (col 36)
          

* Remove the above columns and reduce the experiment info matrix to the level of bioloigcal replicates

    ```{r reduce.raw.pheno, cache=F }
    rm.cols <- c(6,8,10,11,36)
  
    expt.dat.240 <- droplevels.data.frame(unique(expt.dat.720[,-c(rm.cols)]))
    dim(expt.dat.240)
    ```
    
* Now that we have both the count data and experimental meta data consolidated to bioloigcal replicates, let's check that they are in same order.
    ```{r check.order.count.pheno, cache=F }
    # print the column names of the counts (biological replicate names)
    head(colnames(txi$counts))
    
    #look at name of animal.id (bioloigcal replicate) in experimental info
    head(expt.dat.240$animal_id)
    ```
    
      * Note that column names in the counts are characters while the experimental data animal id is a numeric factor.
      
      * Also, note that each biological sample name in the counts has a "." at the end which will force R to never specify this as anything but a character variable.
      
* Add period to end of animal id, check order, and assign as row names of expt data frame
    ```{r match.pheno.counts, cache=F }
    tmp.names <- paste0(as.character(expt.dat.240$animal_id),".")
    identical(tmp.names,colnames(txi$counts))
    rownames(expt.dat.240) <- tmp.names
    ```

## Pre-filter data and check for outliers

* Filter out low expressed counts (total sum < 10) from txi object
    ```{r rm.low.cts, cache=F }
    # Filter out which transcripts have less than 10 total counts
    rm.zero <- which(apply(txi$counts,1,sum) < 10)
    txi$counts <- txi$counts[-c(rm.zero),]
    
    # Remove low counts from remaining objects in the list
    txi$abundance <- txi$abundance[-c(rm.zero),]
    txi$length <- txi$length[-c(rm.zero),]
    txi$variance <- txi$variance[-c(rm.zero),]
    ```

* Generate pc plot and check outliers
    ```{r check.out, cache=F }
    # Use the counts to create a pc plot and plot the first two
    mypc <- prcomp(t(txi$counts),center = T,scale. = T)
    mypc <- mypc$x[,1:2]
    plot(mypc[,1],mypc[,2]); abline(h=200,col="red")
    
    # Which reps are outliers?
    sort(names(which(mypc[,2] > 200)))
    ```

* Remove outlier biological replicates
    ```{r remove.bio.reps, cache=F }
    # Identify the rows which correspond to the outliers
    rm.bio.reps <- which(mypc[,2] > 200)
    # Subset the txi and pheno objects to remove families with less than 3 bio reps per batch
    txi$counts <- txi$counts[,-c(rm.bio.reps)]
    
    rm.zero <- which(apply(txi$counts,1,sum) < 10)
    txi$counts <- txi$counts[-c(rm.zero),]
    txi$abundance <- txi$abundance[-c(rm.zero),-c(rm.bio.reps)]
    txi$variance <- txi$variance[-c(rm.zero),-c(rm.bio.reps)]
    txi$length <- txi$length[-c(rm.zero),-c(rm.bio.reps)]
    
    sub.phenos <- droplevels.data.frame(expt.dat.240[-c(rm.bio.reps),])
    
    unique(sub.phenos$fam_id)
    ```


* Generate pc plot and check outliers
    ```{r check.out.v2, cache=F }
    # Use the counts to create a pc plot and plot the first two
    mypc <- prcomp(t(txi$counts),center = T,scale. = T)
    mypc <- mypc$x[,1:2]
    plot(mypc)
    ```
    
    * The EW and LGEP are parallel to one another on the plot above.  How would the samples look if we created a PC plot using only the LGEP or EW?
    
    ```{r check.out.ew, cache=F}
    ew.reps <- which(sub.phenos$batch == "EW")
    ew.cts <- txi$counts[,ew.reps]
    rm.zero <- which(apply(ew.cts,1,sum) <= 10)
    ew.cts <- ew.cts[-c(rm.zero),]
    
    mypc <- prcomp(t(ew.cts),center = T,scale. = T)
    mypc <- mypc$x[,1:2]
    plot(mypc)
    sort(names(which(mypc[,2] < -100)))
    which(mypc[,1] > 0 & mypc[,2] < -200)
    ```
      
      * Now look at LGEP:
    
    ```{r checkout.lgep, cache=F}
    lgep.reps <- which(sub.phenos$batch == "LGEP")
    lgep.cts <- txi$counts[,lgep.reps]
    rm.zero <- which(apply(lgep.cts,1,sum) <= 10)
    lgep.cts <- lgep.cts[-c(rm.zero),]
    
    mypc <- prcomp(t(lgep.cts),center = T,scale. = T)
    mypc <- mypc$x[,1:2]
    plot(mypc)
    which(mypc[,1] > 300)
    ```


* Probably should keep an eye on the above samples, but prior to normalization there is nothing to suggest that these samples are "bad"

## Save output
* Now let's save the objects which will be used for normalization
    ```{r save.objects}
    load.counts <- vector("list")
    load.counts$txi_object <- txi
    load.counts$phenos <- sub.phenos
    
    save(load.counts,file="/media/disk6/ARF/RNASEQ/counts/86kSalmon/Step2_Load_Counts.RData",compress=T)
    ```
